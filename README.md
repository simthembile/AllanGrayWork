Description: 
A simple program to simulate the twitter feed of users, based on who they follow. This is a rudimentary example to illustrate a simple solution to the problem with the given example. It is also a bit inefficient since in the last part we check all tweets posted to extract those of only users being followed by a user. A better solution is to add an integer index to the tweet as a kind of timestamp to make this more efficient.

Installation:
Dependencies required are Python 2.7 or 3.X. Install code by simply cloning this repo into a folder and running main.py
